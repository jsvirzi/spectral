# Spectral library

Contains "cryptic" forms of standard algorithms, such as discrete sin/cos transforms, written for extremely efficient execution.
They are written in ANSI C. Embedded processors have more memory now, so the philosophy is to use memory instead of cpu speed.
For example, sine function is written as a lookup table.

There's nothing new in these libraries, that no one has seen before.
They're primarily for me to use, but anyone else can, too.
